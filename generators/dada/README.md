# Dada Engine grammars

The Dada Engine was a precursor to rmutt: its grammar format is slightly different, but mostly compatible. I've adapted Dada's example grammars to the rmutt format to provide some additional examples: many of them generate longer, more complex documents than rmutt's examples.

* **brag.pb**: Bombastic trash-talk
* **crackpot.pb**: Conspiracy theories (currently broken, requires Dada features not present in rmutt)
* **eqn.pb**: Randomized LaTeX equations
* **exam.pb**: Intimidating exam questions
* **legal.pb**: Impenetrable legal documents
* **manifesto.pb**: Very, very serious cultural manifestos
* **pomo.pb**: The classic postmodern essay generator
* **silly-word.pb**: Gibberish words built syllable-by-syllable
* **spout.pb**: Simple but effective profound-statement generator
